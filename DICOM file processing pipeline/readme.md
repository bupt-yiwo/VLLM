- These scripts are designed to handle situations where a folder contains multiple patient DICOM files, with a corresponding CSV file that records relevant information and the storage paths of the DICOM files.

- I have adjusted the code according to file storage specifications, but in real-world tasks, there are often non-standard situations. In such cases, additional processing is required based on the specific circumstances.

- Although this README does not provide detailed descriptions of each file's purpose, detailed annotations are available in the Jupyter Notebooks (.ipynb files), which help explain the functionality and usage of the code.

- You can use this code with confidence, as I have processed over 700GB of data with it and used it for model training.
