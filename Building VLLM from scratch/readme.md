# Readme

Recommended learning sequence: modeling_siglip.py -> processing_paligemma.py -> modeling_gemma.py -> inference.py.

In the notes folder, you can find both the model architecture diagram and code structure diagram generated using Mermaid. (Unfortunately, due to time constraints, I was unable to refine and thoroughly map out the drawings.)"

## How to run

```python
sh launch_inference.py
```
